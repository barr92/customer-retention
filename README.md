# Customer Retention and Churn Analysis - using Machine Learning Models to assist our analysis.

This project delves into the intricate landscape of customer retention and churn dynamics at our Model Fitness branches across the USA. Our objective is to scrutinise the churned customers amongst our users meticulously, unveil key trends and determine the motivations behind membership cancellations. We will collaboratively devise an astute customer retention strategy that fortifies the foundations of member loyalty, ultimately mitigating the escalating churn rates that have come to the forefront of business concerns.

The project included:

1. Carry out exploratory data analysis (EDA) and use Loops to produce distribution histograms automatically and efficiently.
2. Carry out correlation analysis to determine which features were most important for our model and which ones will influence customer churn (e.g. months until the end of the contract.)
3. Building a binary classification model for customers where the target feature is the user's leaving next month.
4. Divide the data into train and validation sets using the train_test_split() function.
5. Train the model on the train set with two methods: logistic regression and random forest.
6. The creation of clusters using K-Means to analyse customer trends
7. Calculate the churn rate by cluster and provide conclusions and recommendations for the customer retention strategy.
